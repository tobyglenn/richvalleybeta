We bought 3 ducks more as pets than anything else. They were being raised out with the area with our new chickens. We wanted duck eggs but we believe we only got one female based on the quack. We have decided to put them for free on craigslist <https://harrisburg.craigslist.org/zip/6176876097.html>. We have found that they are too much work and are very loud. They have since been taken by a somewhat local homesteader.
