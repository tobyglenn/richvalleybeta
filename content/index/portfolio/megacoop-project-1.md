This has been a year 1 and year two project. Stephaine started construction on the coop in 2016. Stephanie hand cut and build the roof trusses to give the coop an angled roof. We decided at the end of 2016 to move it to the other side of the yard closer to the field. We plan on using a method like this <http://www.secrets-of-shed-building.com/Moving_a_storage_shed.html> to move it to the field. We then moved it across the yard and it was a little off angle when we placed it on its new brick foundation. We actually had to bump it with the tractor because it was far to heavy to push. Stephanie has added nesting boxes (built by hand) and purchased and installed a light sensing automatic door opener. She is continuing to make improvements all the time.
