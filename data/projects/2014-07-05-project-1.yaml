description: This has been a year 1 and year two project. Stephaine built the coop in 2016. Stephanie hand cut and build the roof trusses to give the coop an angled roof. We decided at the end of 2016 to move it to the other side of the yard closer to the field. We plan on using a method like this http://www.secrets-of-shed-building.com/Moving_a_storage_shed.html to move it to the field.
