description: We know that you can hire a company or rent heavy equipment and get this done quickly. We felt that we wanted to get to know our land and do our clearing on the cheap. Our approach is to hook up a chain from the back of the truck to a tree and wrap the chain onto itself. We have been able to get the honeysuckle (invasive species in our field) and most of the junk trees out with this method. Its time consuming but we like to think of it as a free gym membership.
