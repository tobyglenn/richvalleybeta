description: We purchased our first set of laying hens from https://www.mcmurrayhatchery.com all arrived and were healthy. We then bought some new hampshires from tractor supply. all of the tractor supply chickes were supposed to be pullets. However, one pullet ended up being a rooster. We ended up loosing a few of each breed over the winter because of hawlk issues (with the chickens free ranging) This year we bought a bunch of new hens from tractor supply and http://kniselys.com/ .
