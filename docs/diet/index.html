<h2 id="walk-1-hour-everyday-two-30-minute-sessions">walk 1 hour everyday (two 30 minute sessions)</h2>

<p>Couch to 5k: (once you have spent a month to two months walking 1 hour per day its time to up the intensity I started with 5mph jogging and 3mph walking on a treadmill going through the workouts as quick as possible do at least two per week)</p>

<h2 id="when-weather-permits-15-minutes-of-sun-per-day-i-do-no-shirt-and-work-in-the-garden-or-walk-outside">When weather permits 15 minutes of sun per day. I do no shirt and work in the garden or walk outside</h2>

<p>It sounds crazy but it really helps: <a href="http://vkool.com/effects-of-sunlight/">http://vkool.com/effects-of-sunlight/</a></p>

<h2 id="healthy-substitutions">Healthy Substitutions</h2>

<p>Soda -&gt; limit/remove and
if needed replace with Juice (only real fruit juices) or Kombucha</p>

<p>Cereal -&gt; replace with whole oats and add real fruit, nuts, and or cacao powder / cacao powder nibs to make a sweet breakfast or snack</p>

<p>Bread -&gt; Wraps or Dave&rsquo;s Killer (or similar) bread</p>

<p>Energy drinks (including zero sugar kind)-&gt; coffee or caffeinated tea</p>

<p>Meat -&gt; beans (will save you money also) &ndash;max of one meal a day with meat or meat substitutes</p>

<p>Milk -&gt; Almond Milk or
Water (if you need an ease in drink goat milk as a interim step)</p>

<p>Yogurt -&gt; switch to plain, preferably Greek Yogurt, any yogurt you choose, pick whole fat only, zero fat yogurt will trick your brain much like fat sugar would and make your body crave more fat. No flavored yogurts - flavors should come from natural products you add, such as raisins, dates, nuts, fresh fruit, cocoa powder, etc</p>

<h2 id="other-notes">Other notes</h2>

<p>Eat a salad with dinner and lunch everyday if possible</p>

<p>Eat 2 whole fruits and many vegetables per day</p>

<p>Fast Food: Never! Instead when you are hungry and on the road, go to a grocery store (or even Walmart) and buy prepackaged salads (we eat the ones in a bag, they are cheaper and have more options than the kits in plastic bowls, just fold the top of the bag over and it will stay upright), grab a fork from the deli section, carrots and hummus, and any nuts or dried fruit you like.  Toss anything you don&rsquo;t finish that you can&rsquo;t save.  It&rsquo;s going to be less money, and you will feel so much better</p>

<p>Diet Soda and other &ldquo;sugar free&rdquo; drinks
I had a big problem with these because I thought they were healthy options in prior attempts to lose weight. They make you hungry, crave actual sugar, and provide no actual nutrition. That is why I recommend actual 100% fruit (and vegetable) drinks with no preservatives if possible. Yes, they have calories and drinking them as a substite for water will cause weight gain but if your actually feeling down and need a pick up there is no alternative for fresh fruit (in any form even juiced). Even better if you have the time blend either frozen or fresh fruit with vegetables and ice to make a smoothie.</p>

<p>Juice cleanse once per month when you hit a plateau (weight loss is marginal during a week where you lower calorie intake and work out harder than the previous week allow a full week at the plateau before cleansing)

<p>Medical Weight Loss Center

loss on a cleanse)
<a href="http://harrisburgmedicalweightloss.com/">http://harrisburgmedicalweightloss.com/</a>
places like this, also known as &ldquo;fat doctors&rdquo; usually do not take insurance, give you additional advice on eating, diet control, and what you need to do at your current weight (my problem was lack of energy and they suggested d ribose and for me to triple my protein intake along with taking the prescription medication temporarily), provide additional accountability by doing monthly weigh ins, and provide you with prescription only pills -&gt; I did 3 visits at $200 -&gt; the medication costs slightly extra (and depends on what they prescribe)</p>

<p>I personally used audible to listen to most of the books above. It allows me to listen when I am doing chores around the farm/house and when I am walking into/out of work.</p>

<p>Some books can be &ldquo;rented&rdquo; for free with a library card and the overdrive app. It&rsquo;s clunkier than audible and you have to wait in a queue but the price of free is worth it for the titles available from your library as audio books.</p>
